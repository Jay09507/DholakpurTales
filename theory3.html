Chutki knew all this, And she did not wanted to be Kalia's girlfriend. But Kalia was very stubborn person he always wanted Chutki to become his girlfriend. So he decided to do whatever it takes to impress Chutki. He used to give her and her friends chocolates and spend an uncountable amount of money and countless hours of texting and talking with her. More over he ignored his own friends and spent more of his time with Chutki and her friends. Kalia also gained the respect and trust from Chutki's family. He was very confident that after all this efforts Chutki will be with her forever.

            But Kalia had also made many mistakes while impressing Chutki. He used Harsh language infront of her and also touched her unappropriately a few times. And due to all this mistakes he lost the respect he gained infront of everyone.
